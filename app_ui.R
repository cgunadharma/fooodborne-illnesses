      In order to prepare for the future, there is a dire need right now for a sense of acknowledgement within populations. 
      Climate change has a lot of moving parts to it and can be daunting to understand so we believe that manipulating data 
      may make it easier for us and others to absorb the individual impact it has on everyone's lives.The data set, 
      ([Daily Temperatures of Major Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities)), 
      was found on Kaggle and was collected by a data scientist at H2O.ai, an open source software company in Silicon Valley.  
      There are 1,048,575 observations in this data set with eight features: region, country, start, city, month, day, year, and average temperature. 
      This data set will go a long way in determining where the highest changes in temperature occurred and will allow us to measure multiple climate change variables. 
      We will be able to  answer questions such as: Based on current temperature patterns, which cities will be heavily impacted by climate change and global warming in the near future? 
      Have specific countries experienced no or little climate change?"),

      specific countries like Algiers does not experience a significant amount of temperature change even though global warming is occurring. 
      Additionally, when honing into temperature trends in Seattle over the years (e.g from 1995 and 2019), temperatures had more variation in 2019 than it did in 1995. Although the data weâ€™ve analyzed has been focused on temperature, 
      there is a strong correlation that variation in temperatures are aligned with climate change.")
